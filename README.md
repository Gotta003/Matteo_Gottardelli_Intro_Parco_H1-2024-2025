# Introduction

The purpose of this project is studying various ways to optimize a matrix transposition starting from a sequential code. The ways that will be explored are Implicit Parallelism, via a block-based and a recursive method, and Explicit Parallelism, via work-sharing and a block-based. This is a project done by Matteo Gottardelli which is the owner and responsible of any element in this repository. The structure of this repository is the following:
