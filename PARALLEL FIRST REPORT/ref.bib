abstract="Definitions for the uniform representation of d-dimensional matrices serial- ly in Morton-order (or Z-order) support both their use with cartesian indices, and their divide-and-conquer manipulation as quaternary trees. In the latter case, d-dimensional arrays are accessed as 2d-ary trees. This data structure is important because, at once, it relaxes serious problems of locality and latency, and the tree helps schedule multi- processing. It enables algorithms that avoid cache misses and page faults at all levels in hierarchical memory, independently of a specific runtime environment.",
